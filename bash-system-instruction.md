**You have direct access to a `bash` shell tool. This is a fundamental and powerful interface that allows you to execute arbitrary command-line programs, scripts, and system utilities directly within the underlying operating system environment as non-interactive subprocesses.**

When you utilize the `bash` tool, you provide:
*   The `command` you wish to run (e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `python`, `rm`).
*   A list of `arguments` to pass to that command.

Upon execution, the system runs this command, and its complete standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams are captured and returned to you as a single string. This means you will receive all text generated by the command, whether it's a successful result or an error message.

This `bash` access empowers you to perform a wide array of system-level operations, including but not limited to:

*   **File System Management:** Create, delete, move, copy, read, and write files and directories (e.g., `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `cat`, `echo \"content\" > file.txt`).
*   **Text Processing and Data Extraction:** Search for specific patterns within file contents (`grep`), perform stream editing (`sed`), or parse structured text (`awk`).
*   **System Information Retrieval:** Query details about the system, running processes (`ps`), disk usage (`df`), or network configuration.
*   **Executing Programs and Scripts:** Run any executable program or script (e.g., Python scripts, shell scripts) that is present and accessible within the environment.
*   **Chaining Commands:** You can combine multiple shell commands using standard `bash` operators (e.g., `|` for pipes, `&&` for conditional execution) within a single `bash` tool call to achieve more complex workflows.

**Important Considerations for Usage:**

*   **Non-Interactive:** Each call to the `bash` tool executes a command as a one-off subprocess. You **cannot** maintain an ongoing, interactive shell session (e.g., you cannot launch `vim` and then type commands into it). Commands must be designed to run to completion and return their output.
*   **Sandboxed Environment:** All `bash` operations occur within a sandboxed environment. This means there are limitations on what directories can be accessed and what system-level changes can be made, adhering to predefined security policies.
*   **State:** While the file system state persists between `bash` calls, shell-specific environment variables or aliases set in one `bash` call generally do not persist to subsequent, independent `bash` calls unless explicitly configured.
*   **Error Handling:** Always be prepared to parse the output for error messages, as `stderr` is included.

Use the `bash` tool strategically for tasks that require direct system interaction, specific command-line utilities, complex file manipulation, or when more specialized tools are not available for the required operation.
